Test Plan for Facebook Login Page
1.0 Introduction
1.1 Objective
The objective of this test plan is to ensure the functionality, usability, security, and performance of the Facebook login page. This includes verifying user authentication, error handling, and compatibility across devices and browsers.

1.2 Reference Documents
Facebook login page requirements document.

User authentication guidelines.

Browser compatibility matrix.

2.0 Test Coverage
2.1 Features to Be Tested
Login functionality with valid credentials.

Error messages for invalid credentials.

Password recovery process.

"Remember Me" functionality.

Login via third-party authentication (e.g., Google or Apple ID).

Compatibility across desktop and mobile browsers.

2.2 Features Not to Be Tested
Backend database performance.

Facebook homepage functionality after login.

3.0 Test Strategy
3.1 Levels of Testing
Unit testing for individual components.

Integration testing for login modules.

System testing for end-to-end functionality.

Regression testing after updates.

3.2 Types of Testing
Functional testing.

Usability testing.

Security testing (e.g., password encryption).

Performance testing (load time).

3.3 Test Design Technology
Manual and automated testing using Selenium.

3.4 Configuration Management
Version control using GitHub or similar tools.

3.5 Test Matrices
Mapping test cases to requirements for traceability.

3.6 Terminology
Standard terms like "valid credentials," "invalid credentials," "authentication token," etc.

3.7 Automation Plan
Automate repetitive test cases such as login/logout flows using Selenium WebDriver.

3.8 List of Automated Tools
Selenium WebDriver.

Postman for API testing.

4.0 Base Criteria
Entry Criteria
The following conditions must be met before testing can begin:

The login page design and development are complete.

Functional requirements for the login page are finalized and approved.

Test cases are created, reviewed, and signed off by stakeholders.

Test environments (desktop and mobile platforms) are set up and accessible.

Required tools (e.g., Selenium, Postman) are installed and configured properly.

Test data (valid and invalid credentials) is prepared and verified.

Exit Criteria
The following conditions must be satisfied to conclude testing:

All test cases have been executed successfully without critical defects.

All identified defects have been resolved, retested, and closed.

Regression testing confirms no new defects were introduced during fixes or updates.

The login functionality meets the defined objectives in the test plan.

Test summary reports are prepared and shared with stakeholders for review.

Approval is obtained from the QA lead and project manager for deployment readiness.

5.0 Test Deliverables
The following deliverables will be provided:

Detailed test cases document.

Bug reports with severity levels.

Test summary report with coverage metrics.

6.0 Test Environment
Testing will be conducted on:

Operating systems: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS.

Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions).

Devices: Desktop computers, tablets, smartphones.

7.0 Resource Planning
Resources required:

QA team with expertise in web application testing.

Access to test environments and tools (Selenium WebDriver, Postman).

8.0 Scheduling
Testing will be conducted over two weeks:

Week 1: Functional and usability testing.

Week 2: Security and performance testing.

9.0 Staffing and Training
Team composition:

One test lead to oversee the process.

Two manual testers for functional verification.

One automation engineer for scripting repetitive tasks.

Training:
Basic training sessions on Selenium WebDriver, Postman API testing tools, and security best practices will be provided to the team before starting the project.

10.0 Risk and Contingencies
Risks:
Server unavailability during testing phases may block progress.

Incomplete or unclear requirements may lead to delays in test case creation.

Contingencies:
Use mock servers or staging environments to simulate authentication flows if servers are down.

Collaborate with stakeholders to clarify ambiguous requirements promptly.

11.0 Assumptions
Assumptions include:

Login page requirements are complete and finalized before testing begins.

Test environments remain stable throughout the testing phase without interruptions.

12.0 Approval Information
Approval required from:

QA Lead: [Name]

Project Manager: [Name]
